## What I found interesting

This article discusses the role of software engineers in the era of Artificial Intelligence. It highlights how students now should use AI to elevate their capabilities, and focus on being able to correct AI generated code when it makes a mistake. It also highlights risks regarding why AI generated code isnt the greatest, such as concerns about security, scalability, and reliability. 

I think this article is a good read because we are currently CS students entering the AI era, and it is important to know how to adapt to this new landscape

Unfortunately the rise of AI and AI dependency has risen the baseline of what is required for an entry level engineer during the time in which I need to be looking for these positions. The ability of coding for AI is also quite poor, it is only able to complete very fundamental ideas with no regard of the structrue or functions in the rest of the files. I'm not owrried that it will replace my job, but it has affected the ability for me to find one. I now need to learn far more complex ideas and fundamentals to prove that I am a capable developer.
